# Android-Service-That-Checks-User-s-Usage-of-Other-Apps
This example application keeps track of other applications that the User opens/ uses. 
Since API 17, Android has deprecated a class that lets the developers check what applications 
that is being taken place on the user's phone. 
I used UsageStatsManager and its method "queryEvents" to check what applications 
are being opened by the user so that you can keep track of it.
